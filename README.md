# Minnow

Minnow is a work-in-progress emulator for the Game Boy platform. It's currently
under development, and I make no guarantees that it will work correctly, or
work at all.

It has only been tested on the following platforms:

* OS X Yosemite (clang++ 6.1.0)

# Dependencies

Minnow builds under C++ 11 and depends on the following:

* GNU make
* clang++ (or g++, if you dare)
* [SDL 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org)
